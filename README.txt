# Automated Selenium Testing with GitHub and Jenkins

This repository demonstrates how to integrate GitHub and Jenkins to run Selenium tests automatically. By setting up this automation, you can ensure that your Selenium tests are executed consistently and efficiently, providing valuable feedback on the functionality and stability of your web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the automation, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

1. **GitHub Account**: You need a GitHub account to host your Selenium test code repository. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://github.com/).

2. **Jenkins Installation**: Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Install Jenkins on your server by following the instructions [here](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).

3. **Jenkins Plugins**:
   - **GitHub Plugin**: Install the GitHub plugin in Jenkins to integrate with your GitHub repository. This plugin allows Jenkins to trigger builds when changes are pushed to your GitHub repository.
   - **Selenium Plugin**: Install the Selenium plugin in Jenkins to execute Selenium tests. This plugin enables Jenkins to run Selenium tests as part of your build process.

4. **Selenium WebDriver**: Ensure you have the appropriate Selenium WebDriver for your chosen browser(s) installed. You can find WebDriver downloads and installation instructions for various browsers [here](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/driver_requirements/).

5. **Selenium Test Code**: Write your Selenium test scripts in the programming language of your choice (e.g., Java, Python). Make sure your tests are compatible with the Selenium WebDriver version you have installed.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the automation:

1. **Clone this Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Configure Selenium Tests**: Write your Selenium test scripts and place them in the appropriate directory within the cloned repository.

3. **Commit and Push Changes**: Commit your changes to your local repository and push them to your GitHub repository:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added Selenium test scripts"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Create Jenkins Job**:
   - Open Jenkins in your web browser and create a new job.
   - Configure the job to pull the code from your GitHub repository.
   - Add a build step to execute your Selenium tests using the appropriate test runner and command (e.g., `mvn test` for Maven projects, `pytest` for Python projects).
   - Save the job configuration.

5. **Set Up GitHub Webhook**:
   - In your GitHub repository settings, navigate to Webhooks.
   - Add a new webhook and configure it to point to your Jenkins server's webhook URL.
   - Ensure the webhook triggers on push events.

6. **Test Automation**:
   - Make a change to your Selenium test code and push it to GitHub.
   - Verify that Jenkins automatically triggers a build and executes your Selenium tests.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can integrate GitHub and Jenkins to automate the execution of your Selenium tests. This automation streamlines your testing process, providing rapid feedback on the functionality and reliability of your web applications.
